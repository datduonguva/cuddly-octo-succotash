## Introduction
Predicting word complexity is a natural language processing task that given an input string and a specified substring, the model should make a prediction for the complexity of that substring. The data set were annotated by having human labellers grading the level of complexity fo the word phrase. The complexity of the a phrase is defined as the number of annotators who mark the phrase as complex over total number of annotators
